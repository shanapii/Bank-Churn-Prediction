In todayâ€™s highly competitive banking industry, retaining customers is crucial for maintaining growth and profitability. Customer churn, or the rate at which customers stop doing business with a bank, can have a significant financial impact. Predicting which customers are at risk of leaving allows banks to implement targeted retention strategies, ensuring a more loyal and satisfied customer base.

Bank Churn Prediction is a machine learning project that focuses on identifying customers who are likely to leave the bank. By analyzing customer behavior, financial transactions, and demographic data, we can develop a predictive model that classifies customers into two categories: those who will remain with the bank and those likely to churn. This prediction enables proactive customer management, helping banks reduce churn rates by understanding key factors influencing customer decisions.

OBJECTIVE:

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict customer churn using historical data. The dataset includes various features such as customer demographics, account balance, tenure, and activity level. The model will help identify customers at high risk of leaving, allowing the bank to take preventive measures to retain them.
